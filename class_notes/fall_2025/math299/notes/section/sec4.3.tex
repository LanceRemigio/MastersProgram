\begin{theorem}[Generalized Hahn-Banach Theorem]
    Let \( X  \) be a real or complex vector space and \( p  \) a real-valued functional on \( X  \) which is subadditive, that is, for all \( x,y \in X  \),  
    \[  p(x+y) \leq p(x) + p(y), \tag{1} \]
    and for every scalar \( \alpha \) satisfies 
    \[  p(\alpha x ) = | \alpha |  p(x). \]
    Furthermore, let \( f  \) be a linear functional which is defined on a subspace \( Z  \) of \( X  \) and satisfies 
    \[  | f(x) |  \leq p(x) \ \ \forall x \in Z.  \]
    Then \( f  \) has a  linear extension \( \tilde{f} \) from \( Z  \) to \( X  \) satisfying 
    \[  | \tilde{f}(x) |  \leq p(x).  \ \  \forall x \in X  \]
